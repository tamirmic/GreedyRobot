The Greedy Robot project involves navigating a robot to a treasure on a two-dimensional grid while adhering to specific movement constraints. Starting at an integral point (xr, yr), the robot must reach the treasure located at (xt, yt) using the shortest possible path. The robot can move North (N), South (S), East (E), or West (W), with each command moving it one step in the respective direction. The shortest distance is calculated as |xr - xt| + |yr - yt|, but the robot is restricted by a rule that prevents it from moving in the same direction more than max_distance steps consecutively. The program recursively generates all valid shortest paths that satisfy this constraint. Input to the program consists of five command-line arguments: max_distance, the maximum steps allowed in one direction; robot_x and robot_y, the robot's starting coordinates; and treasure_x and treasure_y, the treasure's coordinates. The output includes all unique shortest paths as strings of directional commands, such as NNEEENENE, followed by the total number of paths. If no valid paths exist under the given constraints, the program outputs nothing.
